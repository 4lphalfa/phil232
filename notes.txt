    There are no differences between the races and sexes as such?

11.
Surley we would object to a social hierarchy based on real differences of intelligence.
So the problem with sexism isnt just treating equals unequally

12.
"[I]nstead, we should make it quite clear that the claim to equality does not depend on intelligence, moral capacity, physical strength, or similar matters of fact. ...
The principle of the equality of human beings is not a description of ..."

13.
IF it's not about intelligence or rationality, what does matter?
Betham:
The question is not, Can they reason? Not Can they talk? But, Can they suffer?

16.
Would you conduct the experiment on a human orphan baby?
* If not, conductin it on an animal looks like speciesism.
    Adults apes and cats are more conscious of what is happening to them, more self-directing and just a sensitive to pain as human babies.
* Is it the human baby's potential that is relevant?
    Then what should we say about brain damaged human babies? -or about abortion -or contraception?

17.
Singer rejects speciesism

Pojman Utilitarianism
    Conscience can not be used to decide because people's conscience varies.
    Love can't be used to decide because you shouldn't love someone more than others.
    "Do unto others as you would have them unto you" only works in simple situations

Utilitarianism - Jeremy Bentham (1784-1832)
    If your policy is causing suffering, it is morally worng
    When we're thinking about morality, we need to think about the effect it has on people

"By Utilitarianism here is meant the ethical theory, that the conduct which, under any given circumstances, it objectively right, 
    that which will produce the greatest amount of happiness on the whole;" - Sidgwick

Utilitarianism
* Teleological/Consequentialist
* Hedonist/Eudaimonist
* Universalist (as opposed to egoist)
    Make morality more imperical

The Principle of Utility
What makes an act morally right is that is has the best overall consequences of everyone concerned.

"Not that there is or ever has been that human creature breathing, however sutpid or perverse, who has not on many, perhaps on most occasions, defered to it." - Bentham

"Now, pleasure is in itself a good: nay, even setting aside immunity from pain, the only good: pain is in itself an evil;
    and, indeed without exception, the only evil; or else the words good and evil have no meaning" - Bentham

Hedonism
    The view that pleasure is the one ultimate good
    Pleasure is good in itself
Criticisms:
    'Not all' (Bentham would say that the pleasure is still good, but you must also consider the consequences of the choice)
    'Not only' (ex. justice, Bentham would say that justice is good because is causes and pleasure)

John Stuart Mill (1806-1873)

"As between his own happiness and that of others, utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator." - Utilitarianism, Ch.2

Some difficulties in working out the details
* What does "the greatest happiness for the greatest number" mean? (Does it matter how the happiness is distributed)
* Is the quantity of pleasure all that matters? 

How to weigh consequences
Mentham's Hedonic Calculus
    ~ Intensity
    ~ Duration
    > Certainty
    > Propinquity
    - Fequndity
    - Purity
    * Extent

The pleasures of
    Intellect
    Moral Feeling
    Imagination
    Friendship
Are ususally defended as better in quantity. 
But should be defended as better in quality.

Mill:
Dignity is an essential part of happiness.
No one who knows it would give it up for any amount of lower pleasures.

Some difficulties in working out the details
* What does "the greatest happiness for the greatest number" mean? (Does it matter how the happiness is distributed)
* Is the quantity of pleasure all that matters? 
* Should we be weigh the consequences in each case?

Should you pay her when she's done? (Lawn mower)

Act Utilitarianism
    - Evaluates individual acts using the Principle of Utility
Rule Utilitarianism
    - Evaluates acts according to a system of moral rules
    - Evaluates the moral rules using the Principle of Utility
A right action is one that follows a system of moral rules the adoption of which maximizes utility

What makes it wrong to lie?
    (Destruction of trust)

Some External Criticisms
* The theory's implications are absurd.
* Utilitarianism asks too much. (No rest)
* Utility conflicts with justice.

The theory's implications are absurd.
* It seems to tell us that lying, killing, stealing, torture, etc. are sometimes morally correct.
Utilitarian Responses
* We're committed to making the best of bad situations.
* Let's use reason rather than custom as a guide to morality.
