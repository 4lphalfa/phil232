2.
"We are discussing no small matter, but how we ought to live" - Socrates

3.
Ethics/Moral Philosophy:
An attempt to achieve a systematic understanding 
of how we ought to live

4.
A theory of Value
What is good, right, just?
What is worth doing,
worth having,
or worth being?
    Want to be able to justify an action
    Think about life like a story
        if there is no value in the story, it is pointless
    Utilitarians - see the pleasure as the good
        some want to seperate the pleasure from happyness
        Pleasure a particular sensation
        Happyness, much broader, living the good life

5.
A theory of what makes an act Right

6.
The good, the bad, and the difference - NYTimes Mag
* Record your first instinct individually
* take a position (As a group if possible) on what the right thing to do is
* Give your reasoning in support of that position (principles)
    Is it ok to use someone else's Netflix account

7.
Moral Principles
    We want them to be
    * Unambiguous
    * Correctly Applied
    * Well founded
    We want them to give us
    * A way of deciding what to do
    * A way of explaining our choices to others
    * A way of reaching agreements we can all live with

8.
Peter Singer
Animal Liberation
"A libertion movement demands an expansion of our moral horizons..."

9.
Speciesism
A prejudice in favour of the interests of members of one's own species.

10.
What is the basis of our objection to racism and sexism?
    There are no differences between people?
    There are no differences between the races and sexes as such?

11.
Surley we would object to a social hierarchy based on real differences of intelligence.
So the problem with sexism isnt just treating equals unequally

12.
"[I]nstead, we should make it quite clear that the claim to equality does not depend on intelligence, moral capacity, physical strength, or similar matters of fact. ...
The principle of the equality of human beings is not a description of ..."

13.
IF it's not about intelligence or rationality, what does matter?
Betham:
The question is not, Can they reason? Not Can they talk? But, Can they suffer?
    
    Equal consideration to all interests
    Anything that has interests, deserves to have its interests considered

14. 
"Bentham does not...

15.
"The basic principe of equality does not require equal or identical treatment,
It requires equal consideration." p.2

    What matters is your interests
    
16.
Would you conduct the experiment on a human orphan baby?
* If not, conductin it on an animal looks like speciesism.
    Adults apes and cats are more conscious of what is happening to them, more self-directing and just a sensitive to pain as human babies.
* Is it the human baby's potential that is relevant?
    Then what should we say about brain damaged human babies? -or about abortion -or contraception?

17.
Singer rejects speciesism
But he does not claim that all lives are of equal worth.

Pojman Utilitarianism
    Conscience can not be used to decide because people's conscience varies.
    Love can't be used to decide because you shouldn't love someone more than others.
    "Do unto others as you would have them unto you" only works in simple situations

    The principle of keeping promises is called deontology
    Teleolgical/Consequentialist ethics, choose the action that does the most good

Utilitarianism - Jeremy Bentham (1784-1832)
    If your policy is causing suffering, it is morally worng
    When we're thinking about morality, we need to think about the effect it has on people

"By Utilitarianism here is meant the ethical theory, that the conduct which, under any given circumstances, it objectively right, 
    that which will produce the greatest amount of happiness on the whole;" - Sidgwick

Utilitarianism
* Teleological/Consequentialist
* Hedonist/Eudaimonist
* Universalist (as opposed to egoist)
    Make morality more imperical

The Principle of Utility
What makes an act morally right is that is has the best overall consequences of everyone concerned.

"Not that there is or ever has been that human creature breathing, however sutpid or perverse, who has not on many, perhaps on most occasions, defered to it." - Bentham

"Now, pleasure is in itself a good: nay, even setting aside immunity from pain, the only good: pain is in itself an evil;
    and, indeed without exception, the only evil; or else the words good and evil have no meaning" - Bentham

Hedonism
    The view that pleasure is the one ultimate good
    Pleasure is good in itself
Criticisms:
    'Not all' (Bentham would say that the pleasure is still good, but you must also consider the consequences of the choice)
    'Not only' (ex. justice, Bentham would say that justice is good because is causes and pleasure)

John Stuart Mill (1806-1873)

"As between his own happiness and that of others, utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator." - Utilitarianism, Ch.2

Some difficulties in working out the details
* What does "the greatest happiness for the greatest number" mean? (Does it matter how the happiness is distributed)
* Is the quantity of pleasure all that matters? 

How to weigh consequences
Mentham's Hedonic Calculus
    ~ Intensity
    ~ Duration
    > Certainty
    > Propinquity
    - Fequndity
    - Purity
    * Extent

The pleasures of
    Intellect
    Moral Feeling
    Imagination
    Friendship
Are ususally defended as better in quantity. 
But should be defended as better in quality.

Mill:
Dignity is an essential part of happiness.
No one who knows it would give it up for any amount of lower pleasures.

Some difficulties in working out the details
* What does "the greatest happiness for the greatest number" mean? (Does it matter how the happiness is distributed)
* Is the quantity of pleasure all that matters? 
* Should we be weigh the consequences in each case?

Should you pay her when she's done? (Lawn mower)

Act Utilitarianism
    - Evaluates individual acts using the Principle of Utility
Rule Utilitarianism
    - Evaluates acts according to a system of moral rules
    - Evaluates the moral rules using the Principle of Utility
A right action is one that follows a system of moral rules the adoption of which maximizes utility

What makes it wrong to lie?
    (Destruction of trust)

Some External Criticisms
* The theory's implications are absurd.
* Utilitarianism asks too much. (No rest)
* Utility conflicts with justice.

The theory's implications are absurd.
* It seems to tell us that lying, killing, stealing, torture, etc. are sometimes morally correct.
Utilitarian Responses
* We're committed to making the best of bad situations.
* Let's use reason rather than custom as a guide to morality.

Utilitarianism asks too much (No rest)
* It seems to tell us we can never morally justify going to a movie.
Utilitarian Responses
* There may be more utility in well rounded, flourishing individuals who don't always try to directly maximize utility.
* Entertaining yourself isn't bad in itself, it just really is not the morally best thing you can do.

Utility conflicts with justice
* Utility seems to be maximized by framing a humeless person to prevent riots
Utilitarian Responses
* The consequences of violating individual right are severe -but in extreme cases it may be the right thing to do.
* The reason we value what we call justice is that it's a cluster of generally utility maximizing principles
* Our duration of justice conflict with each other. Utility can be a referee.

Negative Responsibility
Is killing worse than letting die?

Deontological moral theory
* Focuses on duty and moral rules
* Defines the (morally) right independently on the good (consequences)

Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)
Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals 1785

Many things are good, 
But only the good will is unconditionally good. 

What is the good will?
    The determination to do what reason tells us is our moral duty
Only acts done from the motive of duty have full moral worth.

Hypothetical Imperatives:
    If you want A, you should do B
Categorical Imperatives:
    Regardless of your particular wants and desires, you should do B.
Kant: Morality is a matter of Categorical Imperatives.

The Categorical Imperative (First Formulation)
Act only according to that maxim which you can will to be a universal law.

How you apply the Categorical Imperative
    Form a maxim capturing your intended action, 
    Then ask:
        - Can I concieve of it functioning as a universal law?
        - Can I will it to function as a universal law?
    If so, it's universalizable and a morally permissible act, otherwise not.

Forming your maxim
    Your Maxam: when in these circumstances, I will perform this act with this aim
    Then you imagine the world your maxam yields,
    a world where everyone follows your maxim as if it was a law of nature
    Conception: Could it work as the universal way of achievinv this aim?
    Willing: If I imagine myself in every position is society, would I will it in each of those positions? Does this contradict something any rational being necessarily wills?

Can I make a false promise when I'm in a mind?
[I]t must be rejected, not because of any harm is will bring to myself or ..." [ak 4...]

Can I leave the less fortunate to help themselves?

Testing for Contradictions
Your maxam: when I am well off and others are desperate, I will help no one, to enjoy myself
Passes the Conception test
Fails the Willing test

The Categorical Imperative (Second Formulation)
"Always treat humanity, in your own person and in the person of every other, as an end, never mearly as a means?

Even  of the liar is trying to achieve a good end, "his way of pursuing this end is, bu its mere form, a crime of mand against... - The Metaphysics of Morals


Speciesism and the Idea of Equality - Bonnie Stienbock
    (Treatment depends on the interests they have)

Cruelty is the infliction of unnecessary suffering, and it's always wrong.
"What is philosophically interesting is whether we are justified in having different standards of necessity for human suffering and for animal suffering." - p.251

* Singer is right that sentience is enough to support a requirement for moral treatment.
* But rationality and a capacity for self respect are also relevant to moral treatment.

Other Morally Relevant Features of Humans
* We are responsible for what we do - autonomous
* We are capable of altruistic motivation
* We can do moral reasoning and treat others fairly or unfairly
* We desire dignity and self respect

No class Monday
Papers due on Tuesday

Other Morally Relevant Features of Humans
* We are responsible for what we do - autonomous
* We are capable of altrustic motivation
* We can do moral reasoning and treat others fairly or unfairly
* We desire dignity and self respect
Do people who act on moral principles have mora inherent value than people who just act from sympathy?
Or does any degree of these capabilities get you full membership?

Dignity and the Value of a Life
The desire for dignity and self respect entitles it sbearers to a higher moral status.
* So human lives are more valuable than animal lives
* And human suffering is worse than nonhuman suffering
Singer accepts that human lives have more value, but rejects her conclusion that human suffering matters more than similar non-human suffering.
    (Each of us is capable of experiencing more pleasure than an animal)

"But freedom from suffering is in general, a minimal condition for exerfising there capacities,..." Stienbock p.254

Isn't it obvious that
if we have a starving human child and a starving dog/cow/dolphan and an only feed one of them
the morally right thing to do is feed the human?
Should we perform a "necessary experiment" on a normal adult pig or on "a human being so severely limited that he lacked the intellectual capacities of an adult pig"?
    (Stienbock wants to still do it to the pig. But why, Speciesism? We have sentament with the human but not with the pig. You could be born limited, but not as a pig.)
    (Argument for marginal cases)

Feeding hungry Catholic children before hungry heathen children. -This is morally permissible, but treating them equally would be morally better
Feeding starving children before starving dogs. -This is morally permissible, and treating them equally would be morally worse.



Tom Regan - The Case for Animal Rights (Contractarianism)

Indirect Duties to People
Are no substitute for our actual direct duties to animals

Animals are not ends in themselves. (Kant sees animals as tools for us to use)
(Torturing a cat for amusement. The problem is that its very bad training, and can lead to torturing humans and corupts your character)

Was it wrong to kill Hitchbot? (Property issues aside)

The mark of beings with inherent value:
* They are experiencing subjects of life
* They are conscious creatures with individual welfare.
All whe have inherent value have it equally.

* For any other criterion we might propose, not all humans have it.
* So if we believe that all humans have inherent value, we should accept his criterion
* And that lets adult mammals in.

Animal Rights
Not Anamal Welfare
* Giving farm animals more space, more natural environments and more companions does not right the fundamental wrong
* The same goes for more anaesthesia and bigger cages in the lab

There is one moreal right:
* The right not to be harmed on the grounds that doing so benefits others.
    Harm = loss of capacity to form or satisfy desires

The worst harm is death.
* Death obliterates your capacity to form and satisfy desires

Singer rejects speciesism
But he does not claim that all lives are of equal worth.
Most humans have (and many animals do not have)
* Self awareness
* A capacity to form meaningful relationships
* A capacity to form hopes and plans for the future
This is relevant to killing, but his focus is on minimizing suffering.

Singer 
- Moves from
    * Hedonistic utilitarianism for lower animals
    to
    * Preference utilitarianism for mammals
- Rejects replaceability for mammals

Regan's Moral Principles
* Worse-off Principle:
    Avoid the worst harm to an individual that your actions might produce
* Minride Principle:
    Minimize the overriding of individual rights.
* Risk Conscent Principle
    It's morally wrong to transfer risks to those who don't voluntarily choose to take them.

The Prospects for Consensus and Convergence in the Aminal Rights Debate - Gary Varner

Varner
* We do accept thhe transerring of risk without consent - as wen we alter draft policies in time of war.
* without the consent problem Regan's Worse Off principle would apply
    - Allowing a good deal of animal research,
    - ...

Animal Welfare Policy
* Is about reform of reseach
* Works within the system
Animal Welfare Theory
* Many animals are sentient so
* Their suffering is morally significant

Animal Rights Policy
* Is about abolishing research
* Advocates theft, sabotage, violence
Animal Right Theory
* Animals have special moral dignity, so
* Some things can't be done to them to benefit others

Most Amimal Researchers andAgriculturalists
* Think like hedonist utilitarians about amimals
* Thinks like rights theorists about humans

* Rely on a hedonistic utilitarianism
* Invoke replaceability

Sex Work in Canada

C-36 Criminalizes the buying of "sexual services".
The preamble to Bill C-36 sets much braoder goals than the old law: fighting "the exploitation that is inherent in prostitution" and protecting "human dignity and the equality of all Canadians."

The Liberal Party denounced the law and is currently hearing testimony in a process aimed at introducing new policy in 2019.

Cecilia Benoit - Uvic Researcher of Sex Work

Some findings from the first national study of sex work in Canada:
* 24 is the average age of entry
* 29% engaged in sex work before they turned 19
* 43% said they were satisfied with their work
* 82% felt appropriately rewarded
* 1/3 reported having negative childhood experiences
* 1/3 grew up in foster care or ither child services

"Sex workers are average Canadians. They're Caucasian, in their 30's and 40's, and have education and training outside of high school. Most of them don't feel..." - Maclean's, Sept 23, 2014

"We know all to well from tow decades of missing and murdered women in Canada and extensice research by our team and others..." from UBC?

"We believe that prostitution is intrinsically and degrading and harmful to bulnerable persons, especially women." - Justice Minister Peter MacKay, Jan 2014
"A feminist commitment to women's autonomy would support that if a women ghooses to work as a sex worker that she be supported in her choice." - Viviane Namaste, Concordia University

New Zealand Sex Worker Wins Sexual Harassment Case
"In our view this is the appropriate response to adequately compensate the plaintiff..." - New Zealand Human Rights Review Tribunal, Feb 2014

Prostitution - Alison Jaggar

To Decide what to do about prostitution
We need a philosophical theory of prostitution
That will tell us
- What it is
- What if any, is wrong with it

The Marxist
* In capatalist society prostitution is much more wide spread that we realize
* Engles:
  Among the capitalist a married woman "only differs from the ordinary courtesan in that she does not let out her body on piecework as a wageworker, but sells it once and for all into slavery."

"Prostitution is only a specific expression of the general prostitution of the labourer..." - Karl Marx, The Ecomonic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1884
Simone de Beavoir says that economically the prostitute and the married woman are in the same boat, and taht "for both the sexual act is a service."
    (The wife gets more respect, but does more degrading work because she doesn't get time off)

On the Marxist Biew
What is prostitution?
* Treating a human capacity as a mere commodity
What, if anything is wrong with it?
* It alienates us from the process and product of our work, from out co-workers and from our own humanity.
* We are distorted and reduced

Liberalism (Kant, John Stuart Mill)
* Liberal Philosophy places a high value on the capacity for moral choice (autonomy).
* This capacity entitles people to respect and to the promotion of their dignity and liberty.

Liberalism
We should protect individual choices from societal interference as much as possible.
* People's sex lives are private matter. (One feminist view is that this is a disaster because it can lead to domestic abuse)
* But they may be regulated just enough to keep others from harm.

The Moral Status of Sex Work
    from a Liberal Perspective
* It is often degrading as it is currently practiced, but not essentially degrading.
* It is purely a buisness choice - as long as there is no coercion involved.

Liberal Limits on Contracts
Most liberals deny the legitimacy of any contract that:
* Permanently signs away a person's freedom
* Is entered into out of desperation resulting in oppression
* Is entered into involuntarily

Don't Prohibit It
* Many woman in rough economic situations benefit from it.
* The abuse of women is linked to the background conditions - and probably not directly linked to selling sex.
* Sex work could be reshaped into something that would recieve respect.

Martha Nussbaum - Whether from Reason or Prejudice: Taking Money for Bodily Services

Who else takes money for bodily services?
* A perdue chicken factory plucker
* A domestic servant
* A philosophy professor
* A masseuse
* A colonoscopy test model

What explains the stigma?
* Prostitutes have often been seen as a threat to male control of women.
* So it's stigmatized to achieve bounding.
* Sex hierarchy causes stigma.
We accept all sorts of other non marital sexual activity. Why not prostitution?

"Abolish the prostitutes and the passions will overthrow the world; give them the rank of honest women and infamy and dishonour will blacken the universe." - Augustine, De Ordine

"So long as prostitution is stigmatized, people are injured by that stigmatization, and it is a real injury to a person not to have dignity and self-respect in her own society." p.710

What explains the stigma?
* Prostitutes have often been seen as a threat to male control of woman
* So it's stigmatized to achieve bounding
* Sex hierarchy causes stigma.
"So long as prostitution is stigmatized, people are injured by that stigmatization, and it is a real injury to a person not to have dignity and self-respect in her won society." p710

Much of the stigma against prostitution is a hold over from 
* Class prejudices about work
* Victorian anxiety about the body

Most of the real problems of prostitution are common to a wide range of activities engaged in by poor working women.

"[T]he correct response to this problem seems to be to work to enhance the economic autonomy and the personal dignity of members of that class,
    not to rule off-limits an option that may be the only livelihood for many poor wormen and to further stigmatize women who already make their living this way." p.723

Arguments for Criminalization (whic Nussbaum rejects)
* Its risky (not everything risky is immoral)
* Prostitutes have no autonomy. (They are being controlled in their work / they have been forced into the work)
* It involves an invasion of intimate bodily space. 
* It alienates and commodifies one's sexuality. (if we assume that this is true, think about the marrage institution and how it commodifies sex)
* It's shaped by and perpetuates male dominance. 



The Libertarian Sex-Positive Feminists
"Prostitutes are the only emancipated women." - Margo St. James

Radical Feminism
What is prostitution? It is the victimization of women
* It is the archetypal relationship of women to men

Jagger quotes Caren Lindsey:
"We have long held that all women sell themselves: that the only available roles of a woman - wife, secretary, girlfriend - all demand the selling of herself to one or more men." 

Radical Feminism
What is prostitution? It is the victimization of women
* It is the archetypal relationship of women to men
* Its function is to assert the dominance of men over women.
    - meeting the male desire to degrade women
    - supporting male camaraderie and boosting male egos
    - providing a chance to treat a person as an object
* It's a way of controlling all women.

Prostitution reinforces the idea that women are primarily sexual objects who naturally specialize in personal attractiveness.

The objection is not to sex itself or to sex out of marriage, but to coerced sex.

They Don't See Eye to Eye
* Liberal Feminists champion individual rights
* Radical Feminits often see individual rights as a front to protect existing power structures.
* Liberal Feminists see prostitution as sex and so private and deserving protection
* Radical Feminists see prostitution as assult and so not deserving protection

They See Each Other's Flaws
* Liberals who propose mornalizing prostitution have failed to see that this will make sexism worse and harder to fight
* Radical Feminits need to explain what is so harmful about prostitution if the society is already sexist and economically grossly unequal.


Sexual Exploitation and the Value of Persons - Howard Klepper (Kantian)
(Kant - masturbation is and abomination, using the body for sex is using the body as a meer means) (Klepper does not take this view)

Kant: Always treat humanity as an end in itself.
* Of course this rules out deceiving and coercing people.
* But Klepper argues that it also rules out some consensual sex.

Thomas Mappes
    An offer can be a coercive as a threat if it takes advantage of someone's desperate situation.
Klepper:
    This does not go fare enough.
    Explicit, voluntary, informed consent is not always sufficient to tule out being treated as a mere object

Cases of Treating a Consenting Person as a Mere Means
* During consensual sex you are compleately selfish.
* After consensual sex you brag about the seduction and reveal sexual details.
* You know the other person will act in either of these ways, but you go along with it. (Treating herself as a mere means)
