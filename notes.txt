2.
"We are discussing no small matter, but how we ought to live" - Socrates

3.
Ethics/Moral Philosophy:
An attempt to achieve a systematic understanding 
of how we ought to live

4.
A theory of Value
What is good, right, just?
What is worth doing,
worth having,
or worth being?
    Want to be able to justify an action
    Think about life like a story
        if there is no value in the story, it is pointless
    Utilitarians - see the pleasure as the good
        some want to seperate the pleasure from happyness
        Pleasure a particular sensation
        Happyness, much broader, living the good life

5.
A theory of what makes an act Right

6.
The good, the bad, and the difference - NYTimes Mag
* Record your first instinct individually
* take a position (As a group if possible) on what the right thing to do is
* Give your reasoning in support of that position (principles)
    Is it ok to use someone else's Netflix account

7.
Moral Principles
    We want them to be
    * Unambiguous
    * Correctly Applied
    * Well founded
    We want them to give us
    * A way of deciding what to do
    * A way of explaining our choices to others
    * A way of reaching agreements we can all live with

8.
Peter Singer
Animal Liberation
"A libertion movement demands an expansion of our moral horizons..."

9.
Speciesism
A prejudice in favour of the interests of members of one's own species.

10.
What is the basis of our objection to racism and sexism?
    There are no differences between people?
    There are no differences between the races and sexes as such?

11.
Surley we would object to a social hierarchy based on real differences of intelligence.
So the problem with sexism isnt just treating equals unequally

12.
"[I]nstead, we should make it quite clear that the claim to equality does not depend on intelligence, moral capacity, physical strength, or similar matters of fact. ...
The principle of the equality of human beings is not a description of ..."

13.
IF it's not about intelligence or rationality, what does matter?
Betham:
The question is not, Can they reason? Not Can they talk? But, Can they suffer?
    
    Equal consideration to all interests
    Anything that has interests, deserves to have its interests considered

14. 
"Bentham does not...

15.
"The basic principe of equality does not require equal or identical treatment,
It requires equal consideration." p.2

    What matters is your interests
    
16.
Would you conduct the experiment on a human orphan baby?
* If not, conductin it on an animal looks like speciesism.
    Adults apes and cats are more conscious of what is happening to them, more self-directing and just a sensitive to pain as human babies.
* Is it the human baby's potential that is relevant?
    Then what should we say about brain damaged human babies? -or about abortion -or contraception?

17.
Singer rejects speciesism
But he does not claim that all lives are of equal worth.

Pojman Utilitarianism
    Conscience can not be used to decide because people's conscience varies.
    Love can't be used to decide because you shouldn't love someone more than others.
    "Do unto others as you would have them unto you" only works in simple situations

    The principle of keeping promises is called deontology
    Teleolgical/Consequentialist ethics, choose the action that does the most good

Utilitarianism - Jeremy Bentham (1784-1832)
    If your policy is causing suffering, it is morally worng
    When we're thinking about morality, we need to think about the effect it has on people

"By Utilitarianism here is meant the ethical theory, that the conduct which, under any given circumstances, it objectively right, 
    that which will produce the greatest amount of happiness on the whole;" - Sidgwick

Utilitarianism
* Teleological/Consequentialist
* Hedonist/Eudaimonist
* Universalist (as opposed to egoist)
    Make morality more imperical

The Principle of Utility
What makes an act morally right is that is has the best overall consequences of everyone concerned.

"Not that there is or ever has been that human creature breathing, however sutpid or perverse, who has not on many, perhaps on most occasions, defered to it." - Bentham

"Now, pleasure is in itself a good: nay, even setting aside immunity from pain, the only good: pain is in itself an evil;
    and, indeed without exception, the only evil; or else the words good and evil have no meaning" - Bentham

Hedonism
    The view that pleasure is the one ultimate good
    Pleasure is good in itself
Criticisms:
    'Not all' (Bentham would say that the pleasure is still good, but you must also consider the consequences of the choice)
    'Not only' (ex. justice, Bentham would say that justice is good because is causes and pleasure)

John Stuart Mill (1806-1873)

"As between his own happiness and that of others, utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator." - Utilitarianism, Ch.2

Some difficulties in working out the details
* What does "the greatest happiness for the greatest number" mean? (Does it matter how the happiness is distributed)
* Is the quantity of pleasure all that matters? 

How to weigh consequences
Mentham's Hedonic Calculus
    ~ Intensity
    ~ Duration
    > Certainty
    > Propinquity
    - Fequndity
    - Purity
    * Extent

The pleasures of
    Intellect
    Moral Feeling
    Imagination
    Friendship
Are ususally defended as better in quantity. 
But should be defended as better in quality.

Mill:
Dignity is an essential part of happiness.
No one who knows it would give it up for any amount of lower pleasures.

Some difficulties in working out the details
* What does "the greatest happiness for the greatest number" mean? (Does it matter how the happiness is distributed)
* Is the quantity of pleasure all that matters? 
* Should we be weigh the consequences in each case?

Should you pay her when she's done? (Lawn mower)

Act Utilitarianism
    - Evaluates individual acts using the Principle of Utility
Rule Utilitarianism
    - Evaluates acts according to a system of moral rules
    - Evaluates the moral rules using the Principle of Utility
A right action is one that follows a system of moral rules the adoption of which maximizes utility

What makes it wrong to lie?
    (Destruction of trust)

Some External Criticisms
* The theory's implications are absurd.
* Utilitarianism asks too much. (No rest)
* Utility conflicts with justice.

The theory's implications are absurd.
* It seems to tell us that lying, killing, stealing, torture, etc. are sometimes morally correct.
Utilitarian Responses
* We're committed to making the best of bad situations.
* Let's use reason rather than custom as a guide to morality.





==========

Utilitarianism asks too much (No rest)
* It seems to tell us we can never morally justify going to a movie.
Utilitarian Responses
* There may be more utility in well rounded, flourishing individuals who don't always try to directly maximize utility.
* Entertaining yourself isn't bad in itself, it just really is not the morally best thing you can do.

Utility conflicts with justice
* Utility seems to be maximized by framing a humeless person to prevent riots
Utilitarian Responses
* The consequences of violating individual right are severe -but in extreme cases it may be the right thing to do.
* The reason we value what we call justice is that it's a cluster of generally utility maximizing principles
* Our duration of justice conflict with each other. Utility can be a referee.

Negative Responsibility
Is killing worse than letting die?

Deontological moral theory
* Focuses on duty and moral rules
* Defines the (morally) right independently on the good (consequences)

Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)
Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals 1785

Many things are good, 
But only the good will is unconditionally good. 

What is the good will?
    The determination to do what reason tells us is our moral duty
Only acts done from the motive of duty have full moral worth.

Hypothetical Imperatives:
    If you want A, you should do B
Categorical Imperatives:
    Regardless of your particular wants and desires, you should do B.
Kant: Morality is a matter of Categorical Imperatives.

The Categorical Imperative (First Formulation)
Act only according to that maxim which you can will to be a universal law.

How you apply the Categorical Imperative
    Form a maxim capturing your intended action, 
    Then ask:
        - Can I concieve of it functioning as a universal law?
        - Can I will it to function as a universal law?
    If so, it's universalizable and a morally permissible act, otherwise not.

Forming your maxim
    Your Maxam: when in these circumstances, I will perform this act with this aim
    Then you imagine the world your maxam yields,
    a world where everyone follows your maxim as if it was a law of nature
    Conception: Could it work as the universal way of achievinv this aim?
    Willing: If I imagine myself in every position is society, would I will it in each of those positions? Does this contradict something any rational being necessarily wills?

Can I make a false promise when I'm in a mind?
[I]t must be rejected, not because of any harm is will bring to myself or ..." [ak 4...]

Can I leave the less fortunate to help themselves?

Testing for Contradictions
Your maxam: when I am well off and others are desperate, I will help no one, to enjoy myself
Passes the Conception test
Fails the Willing test

The Categorical Imperative (Second Formulation)
"Always treat humanity, in your own person and in the person of every other, as an end, never mearly as a means?

Even  of the liar is trying to achieve a good end, "his way of pursuing this end is, bu its mere form, a crime of mand against... - The Metaphysics of Morals


Speciesism and the Idea of Equality - Bonnie Stienbock
    (Treatment depends on the interests they have)

Cruelty is the infliction of unnecessary suffering, and it's always wrong.
"What is philosophically interesting is whether we are justified in having different standards of necessity for human suffering and for animal suffering." - p.251

* Singer is right that sentience is enough to support a requirement for moral treatment.
* But rationality and a capacity for self respect are also relevant to moral treatment.

Other Morally Relevant Features of Humans
* We are responsible for what we do - autonomous
* We are capable of altruistic motivation
* We can do moral reasoning and treat others fairly or unfairly
* We desire dignity and self respect

No class Monday
Papers due on Tuesday

Other Morally Relevant Features of Humans
* We are responsible for what we do - autonomous
* We are capable of altrustic motivation
* We can do moral reasoning and treat others fairly or unfairly
* We desire dignity and self respect
Do people who act on moral principles have mora inherent value than people who just act from sympathy?
Or does any degree of these capabilities get you full membership?

Dignity and the Value of a Life
The desire for dignity and self respect entitles it sbearers to a higher moral status.
* So human lives are more valuable than animal lives
* And human suffering is worse than nonhuman suffering
Singer accepts that human lives have more value, but rejects her conclusion that human suffering matters more than similar non-human suffering.
    (Each of us is capable of experiencing more pleasure than an animal)

"But freedom from suffering is in general, a minimal condition for exerfising there capacities,..." Stienbock p.254

Isn't it obvious that
if we have a starving human child and a starving dog/cow/dolphan and an only feed one of them
the morally right thing to do is feed the human?
Should we perform a "necessary experiment" on a normal adult pig or on "a human being so severely limited that he lacked the intellectual capacities of an adult pig"?
    (Stienbock wants to still do it to the pig. But why, Speciesism? We have sentament with the human but not with the pig. You could be born limited, but not as a pig.)
    (Argument for marginal cases)

Feeding hungry Catholic children before hungry heathen children. -This is morally permissible, but treating them equally would be morally better
Feeding starving children before starving dogs. -This is morally permissible, and treating them equally would be morally worse.



Tom Regan - The Case for Animal Rights (Contractarianism)

Indirect Duties to People
Are no substitute for our actual direct duties to animals

Animals are not ends in themselves. (Kant sees animals as tools for us to use)
(Torturing a cat for amusement. The problem is that its very bad training, and can lead to torturing humans and corupts your character)

Was it wrong to kill Hitchbot? (Property issues aside)

The mark of beings with inherent value:
* They are experiencing subjects of life
* They are conscious creatures with individual welfare.
All whe have inherent value have it equally.

* For any other criterion we might propose, not all humans have it.
* So if we believe that all humans have inherent value, we should accept his criterion
* And that lets adult mammals in.

Animal Rights
Not Anamal Welfare
* Giving farm animals more space, more natural environments and more companions does not right the fundamental wrong
* The same goes for more anaesthesia and bigger cages in the lab

There is one moreal right:
* The right not to be harmed on the grounds that doing so benefits others.
    Harm = loss of capacity to form or satisfy desires

The worst harm is death.
* Death obliterates your capacity to form and satisfy desires

Singer rejects speciesism
But he does not claim that all lives are of equal worth.
Most humans have (and many animals do not have)
* Self awareness
* A capacity to form meaningful relationships
* A capacity to form hopes and plans for the future
This is relevant to killing, but his focus is on minimizing suffering.

Singer 
- Moves from
    * Hedonistic utilitarianism for lower animals
    to
    * Preference utilitarianism for mammals
- Rejects replaceability for mammals

Regan's Moral Principles
* Worse-off Principle:
    Avoid the worst harm to an individual that your actions might produce
* Minride Principle:
    Minimize the overriding of individual rights.
* Risk Conscent Principle
    It's morally wrong to transfer risks to those who don't voluntarily choose to take them.

The Prospects for Consensus and Convergence in the Aminal Rights Debate - Gary Varner

Varner
* We do accept thhe transerring of risk without consent - as wen we alter draft policies in time of war.
* without the consent problem Regan's Worse Off principle would apply
    - Allowing a good deal of animal research,
    - ...

Animal Welfare Policy
* Is about reform of reseach
* Works within the system
Animal Welfare Theory
* Many animals are sentient so
* Their suffering is morally significant

Animal Rights Policy
* Is about abolishing research
* Advocates theft, sabotage, violence
Animal Right Theory
* Animals have special moral dignity, so
* Some things can't be done to them to benefit others

Most Amimal Researchers andAgriculturalists
* Think like hedonist utilitarians about amimals
* Thinks like rights theorists about humans

* Rely on a hedonistic utilitarianism
* Invoke replaceability

Sex Work in Canada

C-36 Criminalizes the buying of "sexual services".
The preamble to Bill C-36 sets much braoder goals than the old law: fighting "the exploitation that is inherent in prostitution" and protecting "human dignity and the equality of all Canadians."

The Liberal Party denounced the law and is currently hearing testimony in a process aimed at introducing new policy in 2019.

Cecilia Benoit - Uvic Researcher of Sex Work

Some findings from the first national study of sex work in Canada:
* 24 is the average age of entry
* 29% engaged in sex work before they turned 19
* 43% said they were satisfied with their work
* 82% felt appropriately rewarded
* 1/3 reported having negative childhood experiences
* 1/3 grew up in foster care or ither child services

"Sex workers are average Canadians. They're Caucasian, in their 30's and 40's, and have education and training outside of high school. Most of them don't feel..." - Maclean's, Sept 23, 2014

"We know all to well from tow decades of missing and murdered women in Canada and extensice research by our team and others..." from UBC?

"We believe that prostitution is intrinsically and degrading and harmful to bulnerable persons, especially women." - Justice Minister Peter MacKay, Jan 2014
"A feminist commitment to women's autonomy would support that if a women ghooses to work as a sex worker that she be supported in her choice." - Viviane Namaste, Concordia University

New Zealand Sex Worker Wins Sexual Harassment Case
"In our view this is the appropriate response to adequately compensate the plaintiff..." - New Zealand Human Rights Review Tribunal, Feb 2014

Prostitution - Alison Jaggar

To Decide what to do about prostitution
We need a philosophical theory of prostitution
That will tell us
- What it is
- What if any, is wrong with it

The Marxist
* In capatalist society prostitution is much more wide spread that we realize
* Engles:
  Among the capitalist a married woman "only differs from the ordinary courtesan in that she does not let out her body on piecework as a wageworker, but sells it once and for all into slavery."

"Prostitution is only a specific expression of the general prostitution of the labourer..." - Karl Marx, The Ecomonic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1884
Simone de Beavoir says that economically the prostitute and the married woman are in the same boat, and taht "for both the sexual act is a service."
    (The wife gets more respect, but does more degrading work because she doesn't get time off)

On the Marxist Biew
What is prostitution?
* Treating a human capacity as a mere commodity
What, if anything is wrong with it?
* It alienates us from the process and product of our work, from out co-workers and from our own humanity.
* We are distorted and reduced

Liberalism (Kant, John Stuart Mill)
* Liberal Philosophy places a high value on the capacity for moral choice (autonomy).
* This capacity entitles people to respect and to the promotion of their dignity and liberty.

Liberalism
We should protect individual choices from societal interference as much as possible.
* People's sex lives are private matter. (One feminist view is that this is a disaster because it can lead to domestic abuse)
* But they may be regulated just enough to keep others from harm.

The Moral Status of Sex Work
    from a Liberal Perspective
* It is often degrading as it is currently practiced, but not essentially degrading.
* It is purely a buisness choice - as long as there is no coercion involved.

Liberal Limits on Contracts
Most liberals deny the legitimacy of any contract that:
* Permanently signs away a person's freedom
* Is entered into out of desperation resulting in oppression
* Is entered into involuntarily

Don't Prohibit It
* Many woman in rough economic situations benefit from it.
* The abuse of women is linked to the background conditions - and probably not directly linked to selling sex.
* Sex work could be reshaped into something that would recieve respect.

Martha Nussbaum - Whether from Reason or Prejudice: Taking Money for Bodily Services

Who else takes money for bodily services?
* A perdue chicken factory plucker
* A domestic servant
* A philosophy professor
* A masseuse
* A colonoscopy test model

What explains the stigma?
* Prostitutes have often been seen as a threat to male control of women.
* So it's stigmatized to achieve bounding.
* Sex hierarchy causes stigma.
We accept all sorts of other non marital sexual activity. Why not prostitution?

"Abolish the prostitutes and the passions will overthrow the world; give them the rank of honest women and infamy and dishonour will blacken the universe." - Augustine, De Ordine

"So long as prostitution is stigmatized, people are injured by that stigmatization, and it is a real injury to a person not to have dignity and self-respect in her own society." p.710

What explains the stigma?
* Prostitutes have often been seen as a threat to male control of woman
* So it's stigmatized to achieve bounding
* Sex hierarchy causes stigma.
"So long as prostitution is stigmatized, people are injured by that stigmatization, and it is a real injury to a person not to have dignity and self-respect in her won society." p710

Much of the stigma against prostitution is a hold over from 
* Class prejudices about work
* Victorian anxiety about the body

Most of the real problems of prostitution are common to a wide range of activities engaged in by poor working women.

"[T]he correct response to this problem seems to be to work to enhance the economic autonomy and the personal dignity of members of that class,
    not to rule off-limits an option that may be the only livelihood for many poor wormen and to further stigmatize women who already make their living this way." p.723

Arguments for Criminalization (whic Nussbaum rejects)
* Its risky (not everything risky is immoral)
* Prostitutes have no autonomy. (They are being controlled in their work / they have been forced into the work)
* It involves an invasion of intimate bodily space. 
* It alienates and commodifies one's sexuality. (if we assume that this is true, think about the marrage institution and how it commodifies sex)
* It's shaped by and perpetuates male dominance. 



The Libertarian Sex-Positive Feminists
"Prostitutes are the only emancipated women." - Margo St. James

Radical Feminism
What is prostitution? It is the victimization of women
* It is the archetypal relationship of women to men

Jagger quotes Caren Lindsey:
"We have long held that all women sell themselves: that the only available roles of a woman - wife, secretary, girlfriend - all demand the selling of herself to one or more men." 

Radical Feminism
What is prostitution? It is the victimization of women
* It is the archetypal relationship of women to men
* Its function is to assert the dominance of men over women.
    - meeting the male desire to degrade women
    - supporting male camaraderie and boosting male egos
    - providing a chance to treat a person as an object
* It's a way of controlling all women.

Prostitution reinforces the idea that women are primarily sexual objects who naturally specialize in personal attractiveness.

The objection is not to sex itself or to sex out of marriage, but to coerced sex.

They Don't See Eye to Eye
* Liberal Feminists champion individual rights
* Radical Feminits often see individual rights as a front to protect existing power structures.
* Liberal Feminists see prostitution as sex and so private and deserving protection
* Radical Feminists see prostitution as assult and so not deserving protection

They See Each Other's Flaws
* Liberals who propose mornalizing prostitution have failed to see that this will make sexism worse and harder to fight
* Radical Feminits need to explain what is so harmful about prostitution if the society is already sexist and economically grossly unequal.


Sexual Exploitation and the Value of Persons - Howard Klepper (Kantian)
(Kant - masturbation is and abomination, using the body for sex is using the body as a meer means) (Klepper does not take this view)

Kant: Always treat humanity as an end in itself.
* Of course this rules out deceiving and coercing people.
* But Klepper argues that it also rules out some consensual sex.

Thomas Mappes
    An offer can be a coercive as a threat if it takes advantage of someone's desperate situation.
Klepper:
    This does not go fare enough.
    Explicit, voluntary, informed consent is not always sufficient to tule out being treated as a mere object

Cases of Treating a Consenting Person as a Mere Means
* During consensual sex you are compleately selfish.
* After consensual sex you brag about the seduction and reveal sexual details.
* You know the other person will act in either of these ways, but you go along with it. (Treating herself as a mere means)

Last Summer at Target
I Only Date Heroes vs. Future Man of Steel
    Radical Feminists say that sex work only exasperates this problem

Cases of Treating a Consenting Person as a Mere Means
* During consensual sex you are completely selfish
* After consensual sex you brag about the seduction and reveal sexual details
* You know the other person will act in either of these ways, but you go along with it. (Not respecting yourself) (But ignorance is a moral defense)

When does prostitution treat humanity as a mere means?
    When either party intends to treat the other person as a mere means to an end. (Sex worker just having sex for the money) (Treating them just like an animal/thing) 
Any employment relationship in which one of the employer's purposes is to denegrate an employee is similarly immoral.

If the intent is to treat someone as a thing, it's immoral.
* Dwarf tossing contests? 
* $50 to kick a homeless person in the groin? (The intention is clearly to degrade, it is coersive to the homeless person)
* Reality TV (Ignorance? Degrading yourself for money)
* Most prostitution? (You don't intend a dinner date to be exploitive, radical feminists would say that it's still explotive, but ___ would say that it isn't) (kantian says motive matters)

Vehicles and Crashes: Why is this Moral Issue Overlooked? - Douglas Husak

Why we should Think about the Ethics of Driving (Certain types of vehicles that trasfer the risk to others. Heavier, height, ridgid, off roading vehicles)
* Driving personal vehicles causes harm
* Much of the harm is caused culpably

Frivolous trips in crash-incompatible vehicles
pose a substantial and unjustifiable risk to others

Why we should Think about the Ethics of Driving
* Driving SUVs raises the risk to others

Possible Justifications
* You need a SUV?
* You're safer in an SUV? (Only an egoist would say this as a justification)

Why Do We Overlook This Issue? (Most people who work in philosophy have good jobs and own big cars)

"None of the dozens of anthologies assigned to undergraduates in courses in current moral and social..." p.364

Common Errors and Irrationalities in Risk Assessment
1. We overestimate small risks and underestimate large risks.
2. We oversestimate heavily publicized risks.
3. We worry more about risks that are outside our control
4. Most of us think we are above average drivers.
5. We exaggerate risks with catastrophic potential

"Perhaps a final factor provides the most important explanation of why my topic has been overlooked. 
    People tend to regard risky conduct as permissible when they (and those in social group with which they identify) engage in it themselves." p.368


Rich and Poor - Peter Singer

Absolute Poverty
"Absolute poverity is probably the principal cause of human misery today."
"[A] condition of life so characterized by malnutrition, illiteracy, disease, squalid surroundings, high infant motality, and low life expectancy of human decency" - Singer, Rich and Poor

Who are the humgry
Current estimate: 815 Million, or 1 in 9 people

"More people die each year from povery-related causes than died in any one yera during WW2." - Singer 2009
UNICEF estimates that 27000 children under the age of 5 die due to poverty every day.

Absolute Affluence
"The absolutely affluent choose their food for the pleasure of the palate, not to stop hunger; they buy new clothes to look..." - Singer, Rich and Poor

Famine, Affluence and Morality - Peter Singer

The Argument for a Duty to Aid
* If we can prevent something bad without sacrificing anything of comparable moral significance, we ought to do it.
* Absolute poverty is bad
* We can prevent some absolute poverty without sacrificing anything of comparable moral significance.
Therefore we ought to prevent some absolute poverty.

Little Girl Drowning (This case people get)

The Argument for a Duty to Aid
* If we can prevent something bad without sacrificing anything of ~~comparable~~ moral significance, we ought to do it.
* Absolute poverty is bad
* We can prevent some absolute poverty without sacrificing anything of ~~comparable~~ moral significance.
Therefore we ought to prevent some absolute poverty.

Objections Singer Considers
* Distance (Then help the poor closer to you)
* Other People Can Help (This would be true if everyone actually gave $5. But if they don't you have a moral obligation to help as much as you can)
* It's Too Drastic a Revision of Moral Concepts (Singer thinks we should have a drastic revision of our moral cocepts)

"The bread which you withold belongs to the hungry; the clothing you shut away, to the naked; and the money you bury ... - Aquinas quoting Ambrosius

Objections Singer Considers
* Distance (Then help the poor closer to you)
* Other People Can Help (This would be true if everyone actually gave $5. But if they don't you have a moral obligation to help as much as you can)
* It's Too Drastic a Revision of Moral Concepts (Singer thinks we should have a drastic revision of our moral cocepts)
* Utilitarianism Asks Too Much

(Singer's Duty to Aid - if you can do it easily, you have a moral obligation to aid)
(Distinction of what someone should do, and what they are ought to do)

"Since most people are self-interested to some degree, very few of us are likely to do everything that we ought to do.
    It would, however, hardly be honest to take this as evidence that it is not the case that we ought to do it." - Singer, p.238

Practical Considerations
* Leave it to the government. (Singer thinks that if you believe this, you should pressure the government to do more)
* Aid increases overpopulation. (If you think the problem is overpopulation, you should work to fight overpopulation)
* Consumer society would collapse. (We can all do more than we are without causing this drastic result)

How Much do Governments Give?
Four surveys asked US citizens
- What percent of government spending do you thing goes to foreign aid? 15-20%
- Should aid be increaded or decreased? Decreased
- To what level? 5-10%
Actual level of aid at the time: less than 1%

Canada's Foreign aid spending
Canada's foreign aid spending totalled CAD$4.9 Billion if 2014, down sharply from 5.4 billion in 2013, and 5.7 billion in 2011. It was back up to 5.6 billion in 2017

What About Property Rights?
* Utilitarians: If there are property rights they are limited by horrible consequences.
* Aquinas: As long as people are starving they have a natural right to your leftovers.
* Nozick: As long as you didn't get it through force or fraud you have a right to keep all you have and let others starve.
* Singer: Others don't have a right to your posessions, but that doesn't mean there's no moral imperative to help them. 


Defending Limits on the Sacrifices we Ought to Make for Others - Violetta Igneski (Kantian way)

The Extremes
* Singer's Strong Version: Our duty to help includes sacrificing anything of less moral importance than the suffering we're responding to.
* Colin McGinn: We have no duty to help whe it would involve sacrificing anything meaninfgul to us.

In a direct comparison
The lives of the desperate will outweigh almost anything we value

Bernard Williams (do things because they matter to you, not because it is acceptable given a formula. Sometimes what matters is to life your life)
* Your wife and a stranger are drowning and you can only save one.
* If you are weighing the options, you are having "one thought to many."

As Kantian Moral Agents (imperfect duty vs perfect duty)
* We must set ends for ourselves
* We must adopt the obligatory end of aiding people in need

When can we give our own ends priority
When they are objectively more valuable
When they are meaningful to us
Or just because they are ours (as long as we take the duty to aid seriously)?

What Grounds the Duty to Aid?
* We value rational autonomy/agency
What Limits the Duty to Aid?
* We value rational autonomy/agency

How Kantians Interpret the Imperfect Duty to AId
    Thomas Hill
        We ought to help sometimes to some extent
    Barbara Herman
        We ought to help unless doing so would jeopardize our own standing as an autonomous agent

Igneski:
* We are not required to give to the point of marginal utility.
* We are not required to give up leading meaningful lives

Igneski:
* Our projects make our lives worth while, so it is inappropriate to objectively weigh them agains the lives of others.

I agree that, in an ideal world, studying epistemology, classical music, and Italian Renaissance art would be part of every cultivated person's education.
But we live in a world in whicn 27000 children die every day from preventable causes. - Singer 2009

Igneski:
* We are not required to give to the point of marginal utility.
* We are not required to give up leading meaningful lives
* But we are morally required to contribute our share

Our Share
Igneski endorses a compliance condition.
- We can see the duty to aid as a community project
- Our share is determined on the (false) assumption of full compliance

Igneski:
* We do always still have good moral reason to help those in need - but the duty is limited.

"Many argue issues ...
The fully moral life - the fully human life - requires that we pay attention to each of these concerns: to what happens - whether as a result of what we do for fail to do;
    to the kind of person we are - whether virtuous or vicious; 
    and to our duties - to ourselves and others." - Larry Temkin, Thinking about the Needy, Justice, and International Organizations

A Perfect Moral Storm: Intergenerational Ethics and the Problem of Moral Corruption - Stephen M. Gardiner

The Situation Tempts Us to Unhelpful Strategies
    * Distraction
    * Complacency
    * Unreasonable Doubt
    * Selective Attention
    * Delusion
    * Pandering
    * False Witness
    * Hypocrisy
Focus on the Global Storm 
    "tends to draw attention toward various issues of global politics and scientific uncertainty that seem to broblematise action, 
    and away from issues of intergenerational ethics, which tend to demand it." p.408

What To Do?

The Tragedy of the Commons (Commons are a shared and limited resource)
Where everyone promoting their own interest leads to a result that is actually worse for each of them, we face a collective action problem.

Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679)
    Why should a person with no particular concern for others behave morally?

Self Interst
Equality
The State of Nature
    A war of all against all
Solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short

Right of Nature:
    Defend yourself, seeking and using all the advantages of war

First Law of Nature:
    Seek Peace

Hobbesian Contractarianism
    * Morality is based on self-interested, prudential reasoning.
    * Mutual constraint benefits each of us.
    * One-sided constraint would not be rational

What makes an act right:
    It is what is required by the agreement that any rationa, self-interested agent would have good reason to sign on to.

Do not overgraze (Whether they obey or violate, you are always better off to violate)
    Me          You
    Violate     Obey        (Best for me, worst for you)
    Obey        Obey        (Second best for both)
    Violate     Violate     (Most likely to happen because of self-interest) (Tradegy of the Commons)
    Obey        Violate     (Best for you, worst for me)

"[G]reen housel gases mix globally in the atmosphere, and so damages are spread around the world, regardless of where the gasses were emitted,
    Thus, any country taking action incurs the cost, but the benefits are distributed globaly..." NY Times

Limit Emmissions (Effects the poor more than the rich) (Global injustice)
    Me (Rich)   You (poor)
    Violate     Obey
    Obey        Obey
    Violate     Violate
    Obey        Violate
The global storm is exacerbated by unequal vulerabilities

The success of the agreement seems to depend on some kind of enforcement of the contract.

The global community has no sovereign to overawe us all.

The success of the agreement seems to depend on some kind of enforcement of the contract.
But if the parties know they can benefit from more interaction, they have good reason to become constrained maximazers.

The Problem of Future Generations 
    * We don't benefit at all from future generations refraining from polluting.
    * And they bear almost all the costs of our poluting.

Rather than rewarding today's voters with benefits financed ...

* Classic contractarianism handles basic collective action problems well.
* It had great difficulty with an intergenerational...

With most governments being biased towards the interests of the current generation we face a severe, iterated, intergenerational collective action problem.

Rather than a classic Tragedy of the Commons, this is the Tyranny of the Contemporary

The complexity of the climate change problem is
    A Perfectly Convienient Truth


"Die early or grow old: there is no other alternative. And yet, as Goethe said, 'Age takes hold of us by surprise.'
For each man is the sole, unique sebject, and we are often astonished when the common fate becomes our own."

Euthanasia - The Good Death
    Intentionally ending the life of another person with the motive of benefiting that person.

In 1993 the Supreme Court ruled against the claim of Sue Rodriguez
    accepting the government's argument that the law protects the sanctity of life.

Allan D. Scott
Victoria, Oct 8, 2014, Times Colonist letter to the editor

In the recent Supreme Court case the government asked the court to look at the matter from the perspective of a vulnerable person:
    "Why must I be put at risk so someone can terminate their life early?"

On Feb. 6, 2015 the Supreme Court struk down the ban on doctor-assisted death. (Discrimnates the youth and the mentaly disabled)

Voluntary euthanasia will be legal for "a competent adult person who
    1. clearly consents to the termination of life and
    2. has a grievous and irremediable...

As of June 17, 2016 A person in Canada may recieve medical assistance in dying
    Medical assistance in dying occurs when an authorized doctor or nurse practitioner provides ...
* are eligible for Canada health services
* are at leas 18 and capable of making decisions with respect to their health
* have a grievous and irremediable medical condition
* have made unpressured voluntary reqquest for it
* give informed consent after being made aware of alternatives



When Self-Determination Runs Amok - Daniel Callahan

Three Troublesome Turns
    * Legitimizing consenting adult killing
    * Valuing individual pursuit of the good life over the common good
    * Shifting the focus of medicine from fighting sickness to pursuing well-being

The Arguments for Euthanasia (Callahan rejects these)
    * Individual Autonomy
    * Claims of harmful consequences are ill supported 

Reject the Autonomy Argument
    * Since you need help, it's a mutual, social decision - not just self-determination. (Just because they are suffering doesn't give you the legal right to kill them)

"The doctor would have to decide, on her own, whether the patient's life was 'no longer worth living.'" - p.53

Reject the Autonomy Argument
    * Since you need help, it's a mutual, social decision - not just self-determination. (Just because they are suffering doesn't give you the legal right to kill them)
    * Our right to life is not to be given away or alienated "if the price is right"

Liberal Limits on Contracts
    Most liberals deny the legitimacy of any contract that
        * permanently signs away a person's freedom
        * is entered into out of desperation resulting in oppression
        * is entered into involuntarily

Some Limits on Liberty Protect Liberty (points to slavery and dueling)
    * Slavery
    * Dueling
    * Sex Work? (once you legalize, you infringe on sexual autonomy)
    * Drugs? (limit because we are concerned with the great harms to yourself)

Terminally Ill People Still Have Some Liberty
    So choosing suicide is choosing to give up liberty

The Second paper is due Monday Night
Midterm 2
    15 Q's, answer 12
    Everything after Igneski


Euthanasia
    What will Utilitarians say?
(To decide whether the policy is moral, we must think of all the consequences)
(What about a Kantian? Euthanasia destroys rational autonomy, but if their at a point where they've lost their autonomy then it's ok)

Kant discusses suicide in CH2 of the Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals:
(1) A man ...
    For love of myself, I make it my principle to cut my life short when prolonging it threatens to bring more troubles than satisfactions.
So the question is whether this principle of self-love could become a universal law of nature.
If it did, that would be a nature that had a law according to which a single feeling 
    * created a life-affirming push and also
    * led to the destruction of life itself
and we can see at a glance that such a 'nature' would contradict itself, and so couldn't be a nature.
So the naxim we are discussing couldn't be a law of nature, and therefore would be utterly in conflict with the supreme principle of duty.
(When Kant talks about suicide, you're going to have a contradiction in conception)

If we only allow assisted suicide for people in severe pain, then it's not about liberty at all.
It's just about happiness.

A person has a grevious and irrremediable medical condition only if they meet ALL of the following criteria:
    (a) they have a serious and incurable illness, disease or disability
    (b) they are in advanced state of irreversible decline in capability
    (c) that illness, disease or disability or that state of decline causes them enduring physical or psychological suffering that is intolerable to them 
        and that cannot be relieved under conditions that they consider acceptable
    (d) their natural death has become reasonably forseeable, taking into account all of their medical circumstances, 
        without prognosis necessarily having been made as to the specific length of time that they have remaining.

There Will Be Abuse
    * Doctor-patient interactions are confidential
    * Precisely writing the law will not be able to stop the abuse
        - 'Unbearable suffering' and 'terminal condition' are too slippery

(Not only that suicide should be legel, it should be legel to go to a medical professional)

Why limit self determination
    to the suffering,
    or to the dying,
    or to the competent?


What about the potential for misuse? - Dan Brock
    That might be a reason to restrict it to the terminally ill.

One Good Effect of a Pro-Euthanasia Policy
    * It reassures people that if they find themselves in that situation they'll have the option

Some critics admit euthanasia may be morally justified in a particular case
    * But insist that AS A RULE, we can't allow it.
(Because of concerns about misuse)

One Proposed Bad Effect of a Pro-Euthanasia Policy
    * It would undermine trust in doctors and undermine medicine's moral centre
        - but rethink guiding aims of medicine

A Second Proposed Bad Effect of a Pro-Euthanasia Policy
    * Giving people the option can make them worse off.

Slippery Slopes and Loose Cannons
    Why there will be trouble:
        * psychological vulnerability of the elderly and dying
        * health care costs
        * substituted judgement
        * expanding 'terminal illness'
        * prejudice against the disabled


Active and Passive Euthanasia - James Rachels
    It is commonly held that:
        * Passive euthanasia is sometimes morally permissible
        * Active eithanasia is never morally permissible
    But this is wrong.
(Most anti-active-euthanasia perople don't call passive-euthanasia euthanasia at all.)

CMA position prior to the Supreme Court decision:
    [This sounds like passive euthanasia]
    "Euthanasia... must be distinguished from the withholding wor withdrawal of inappropriate, futile or unwanted medical treatment ot the provision of conpassionate palliative care,
        even when there practices shorten life."
Canadian physicians should not participate in it.

CMA position after the Supreme Court decision:
    "The CMA supports patients' access to the full spectrum of end..."

Inoperable throat cancer case:
What justifies passive euthanasia?
    - The person is going to die anywan, and by withdrawing treatment and hastening death we reduce the suffering.
    - But compared to active, passive euthanasia unnecessarily prolongs the agony
    * So the justification for active euthanasia is stronger (In the name of limiting suffering)

Down syndrome and intestinal obstruction case:
    - The need for this relatively simple operation is what determines whetehr the baby will live or die
    * So the common view leads to making life and death decisions on irrelevant grounds.

The case of the six-year old drowning victim:
    - Smith drowns his little cousin
    - Jones goes in to drown hin, sees him slip and fall, and stays to make sure he drowns
    - They are equally morally blameworthy
    * So killing and letting die are not morally distinct

The common argument for the distinction:
    In passive euthanasia the doctor doesn't do anything to cause the death
        -the patient dies from the illness
    In active euthanasia the doctor causes the death
    It is morally wrong to cause death
    So only passive euthanasia is morally acceptable
    * But this argument fails.

Acts and Omissions
    Sometimes one action is performed by not performing some other action.
        * I insult you by not shaking your hand
        * I break a vase by omitting to catch it when you throw it to me.
        * I send you into danger of a foggy night by not mentioning that the bridge is out
        * You need your inhaler and I opt not to hand it to you.
    By omitting to act in one way I have acted in another.

Callahan:
    We need to separate causation from moral culpability
        - A wrongful omission makes a person morally culpable
        - But it does not make them the cause of death.

Callahan's Account                      Caused death?       Morally culpable?       What to call it?
Lethal Injection                        Yes                 Yes                     Doctor killed him
Obit treatment should have provided     no                  yes                     Doctor 'killed' him
Omit treatment at patient request       no                  no                      Doctor didn't kill him, let him die
If we blur the killing/letting die distinction every case where treatment is ineffective will logically call for direct killing on humane and economic grounds.

Why do people assume killing is worse than letting die?
    Most of the killing we hear about is ill-intentioned
    Most of the letting die we hear about is well-intentioned

The only morally relevant difference seems to be that active euthanasia results in less pain than passive euthanasia

Terminal Sedation
    Usually considred to be passive euthanasia, but
        - The death is often not from the disease but from respiratory failure or dehydration from the drugs
    Prior to the new law, the University of Toronto Centre for Bioethics' position was that the is acceptable if the intent is relieve pain and not to hasten death.

The Doctrine of Double Effect - Thomas Aquinas (1224-1272)
    It is permissible to cause an otherwise impermissible harm as a side effect (but not as a means) of producing a good effect

The Intentional Termination of Life - Bonnie Steinbock
(Looks at what Rachael's says, and asks if people actually mistake active and passive euthanasia)
(The way Rachaels interprets the law is the same way doctors interpret the law... and that they're both wrong)

The Down Syndrome Baby Example
    Rachels is right that 
        - This withholding of treatment is unjestified
        - It is the intentional termination of life, i.e. it's passive euthanasia
    * But this is not the kind of withholding the AMA policy, correctly applied, allows.

The Down Syndrome Baby Example
    - The problem is that doctors misunderstand the AMA policy
    - These babies should receive the operation
        - Their death is not imminent
        - Help doesn't depend on extraordinary care.

In some cases withdrawing treatment is not intentional termination of life.
    Case One (Looks to be justifying passive euthanasia, but it isn't)
        Competent adult patients have a right to refuse treatment
        But this does not entail a right to euthanasia
        The aim is protection from unwanted interference
        So the intent of withdrawing treatment need not be ending the life (doctor's intent is to recognize your right to refuse treatment)

A lot Hinges on the Differences Between
    - Intending and Forseeing
    - Ordinary and Extraordinary Care
The Withdrawal of Life-Prolonging treatment is not necessarily Passive Euthanasia

Is there a significant moral difference between an intended outcome and a merely forseen outcome of an intentional action?
    Steinbock thinks there can be.
- A doctor may intentionally withdraw treatment because the patient's refusal of the treatment requires her to do so.
    The doctor is not free to prevent the death
- The she may forsee that the patient will die, but not intentionally cause the patient's death.

Extraordinary Care
    - Has little chance of improving the patient's condition and brings more discomfort than relief
    - "The concept is flexible." p.582
Examples: a respirator for a person in an irreersible coma; continued chemotherapy for a cancer that is not responding to the treatment

In some cases withdrawing treatment is not intentional termination of life.
    Case Two
        Some treatments for spina bifida doesn't improve the patient's condition and brings more pain than relief
        This is extraordinary care
        The aim of withdrawing it is to avoid inflicting more pain
        So the intent of withdrawing treatment need not be ending the life

- Haidt also found that hypnotically induced disgust makes moral judgements more severe

Discussing Disgust - Martha Nussbaum

The Role of Emotion in Moral Judgement
    - It's a mistake to ban emotion from a role in moral debate
    - Emotions have focnitive content
    - Not all emotions are equally relevant

Distaste vs Disgust
    Disgusting things have 'contamination potency.' 
    What the disgusting touches also becomes disgusting.

The Cognitive Content of Emotions
    Anger       This is wrong           Fix it

    Disgust     This is contamination   Flee it

The Cognitive Content of Emotions
    Anger       This is wrong           Fix it
    Fear        This is unsafe          Make it safe
    Disgust     This is contamination   Flee it
(People tend to use disgust to justify morals, but this is wrong)
(Fixing it, and making it safe are good responses, but fleeing isn't)

"[U]ltimately the basis for all disgust is us -- that we live and die and that the process is a messy one emitting substances and odors that make us doubt ourselves and fear our neighbours." 
    - William Miller quoted in Nussbaum's Hiding From Humanity

We stigmatize others as (disgusting) animals as a way of denying our own animal nature.

The Cognitive Content of Emotions
    Anger       This is wrong           Fix it
    Fear        This is unsafe          Make it safe
    Disgust     This is contamination   Flee it
Anger and fear tell us something that can contribute to moral reasoning
Disgust does not, and it is counterproductive.

Disgust is Counterproductive
    - It inspires restriction of liberty in the absence of harms
    - It's tendency to project leads to unjust hierarchies
    - Even if at first carefully targeted, it will spread irrationally.

Shame
(There is a trend in shaming, to forget about whether they have control over it)
(To punish)


What are the good and bad consequences of pornography?

Pornography and Degradation - Judith M. Hill (Thinks taking a utilitarian approach is hard to do)

Degradation
    "Degradation involves being treated as though one were a means only, as though one were not an end in herself, as though one were something less than a person." p.40
    But this is not sufficient for degradation
    It's also necessary that the person be perceived as being treated that way. (It sends the message that the person deserves it)
    
A View She Rejects
    - It's sometimes thought that by degrading a person you actually lower that person's moral worth.
    - They imagine that when they degrade a person it is a test of their worth - if their target pups up with it, they conclude that they deserve it.
    - But that's wrong (you can't forfeit the right to be treated like a human being)

Thomas (not Judith) Hill
    When someone is aware that his rights are being violated and the cost of objecting isn't to high
        if he fails to insist on his rights,
        then he fials in his moral duty to himself

Judith Hill
    It might be better to thinkk of this in terms of moral courage instead.

Does paying a homeless man to be kicked in the groin degrade him and all homeless people?

Victim Pornography
    The graphic depiction of situations in which women are degraded by sexual activity, viz.:
        - An agent treats a women as a means of obtaining sexual pleasure, while showing no consideration for her pleasure, desires or well-being
        - A women not only receives, but suggests such a treatment
    "Depictions of women being bound, beaten, raped, mutilated, and as often as not, begging for more." (Not trying to suggest the actresses are individually degraded)
    Hill's Thesis:
        Victim Pornography degrades all women

"[P]ornography degrades women because it treats them as members of a class which has no honor and is not entitled to respect." p.49
"The perspective offered by Victim Pornography is that, in general, women are narcissistic, machochistic, and not fully persons in the moral sense." p.48

Hill's claim is not that by spreading these depictions Victom Pornography is responsible for degative attitudes about or violent behaviour towards women
(Good examples do not counteract this because she is not concerned about the effects.)

Myrna Kostash (Not a Kantian)
    - Pornograph sends a political message of inequality and domination.
    - Since it's draped in erotism, not liking this power structure is criticized as prudery.

Kostash
    "In our culture relations of dominance and submission between men and women are seen as sexy."
    We are surrounded by the "pretty porn"

"We have somehow to make our way through the city as though pornography had nothing to do with us." - Kotash


Pornography: The Other Side - Ferrel Christensen

Christensen:
    - Pornography is not morally bad in itself.
    - People oppose it because they have mistake ideas about sex.






==========
2018-06-01
==========

Criticisms he Rejects:
    - Pornography is dehumanizing. (What could be more human than two humans having sex) (Critics are not criticizing the sex itself)
    - It treats people as objects and denies our completeness
        - "Men react impersonally to the stripper's body and sexual aura; girls react to the pop star as a peron, not as a sexy body." - Faust quoted on p.521
    - It detaches sex from romantic love. (Who cares? Men are more interested in sex than women, women are more interested in romance.)

Christensen:
    All these complaints grow out of a belief that sex is shameful.

Ann Garry
    Certain ideas about sex make pornography degrading to women
    One reason that pornography ends up harming women is that many consumers of pornography think of sex as generally harmful to women

Andrea Dworkin
    - Women are raped, violent, and humiliated as entertainment. 
    - Then the pornography is used against other women. (As a threat, reinforces the idea that women are natural victims)
    - This creates terror, compliance, and silence in women. 
Pornography sexualizes inequality.

Christensen:
    "It is very, very difficult even to recognize the real sources, of much less to consciously overcome, the beliefs and one has been indoctrinated with and the feelings one has been conditioned to have; they seem so natural, so obviously right. But the price humanity has always had to pay for such blindness is a terrible one." p.524
(Says the feminist have conditioned us to believe porn is bad)

Christensen: Pornography does not degrade woemn.
    The critics are paranoid
        - If men open doors for women the message is women are helpless.
        - If women 'do things for men' the message is women only exist to serve men. 
        - Multiple woemn: a harem
        - Multiple men: a gang rape

Are the feminist critics of pornography paranoid?

Harry Brod
    Pornography increases men's power as a group, but harms them as individuals.
    "The female is primarily there as a sex object, not sexual subject. 
    Or, if she is not completely objectified, since men do want to be desired themselves. 
    Hers is at least a subjugated subjectivity. 
    But one needs another independent subject, not an object or a captured subjectivity, if one either wants one's own prowess validated, or if one simply desires human interaction. 
    Men functioning in the pornographic mode of male sexuality, in which men dominate women, are denied satisfaction of these human desires." - Harry Brod

Wendy McElroy
    "Degrading is a subjective term. I find commercials in which women become orgasmic over soapsuds to be tremendously degrading. 
    The bottom line is that every women has the right to define what is degrading and liberating for herself.
(Judith Hill would say that degradation is treating them like they don't matter. This might be a step towards it, but it is not actual degradation.)
    The assumed degradation is iften linked to the 'objectification' of women: that is, porn coverts them into sexual objects.
    ...Usually, the term 'sex objecti' means showing women as 'body parts', reducing them to physical objects.

Feminism, Moralism, and Pornograhpy - Ellen Willis

"I'm black and blue from the Rolling Stomes and I love it."
Black and Blue - The Rolling Stones
WAVAW(Women Against Violence Against Women) and WAP(Women Against Pornography)
(Willis is for WAVAW but against WAP, its not clear that attacking pornography is the right thing to do)

Ellen Willis
    - Chivalry and pornography both work to control women
    - But the real cause of violence against women is men's hostility towards women combined with their power to act on that hostility and get away with it.

Pornography as Bad Cop
    "However loudly people proclaim that pron is a wholesome as granola, the essence of its appeal is that emotionally it remains taboo." p.461

Conservatives see pornography through a patriarchal lens:
    - It, like rape, is an expression of vicious male lust and a threat to good women.
Feminists should see it differently:
    - In a patriarchy men confuse sexual desire with predatory aggression, but pornography is not an assult and women are not on the whole sexually 'innocent.'

It's Complicated
    - "Insofar as pornography glorifies male supremacy and sexual alienation, it is deeply reactionary.
    - But in rejecting sexual repression and hypocrisy-which have inflicted even more damage on women than on men - it espresses a radical impulse." p.464

Supporting Erotica While Condemning Porn
    This invites more sexual control of women
        - Good Girl/Bad Girl
        - Healthy/Sick
        - Honest/Devious

The Anti-porn Feminist has the Wrong Target
    - Sanatized feminine sexuality is as oppressive to women as predatory masculine sexuality is.
"A major function of misogynist pornography is to scare us into embracing it." [it=the good girl role]

The Housewives of WHite Supremacy - Annie Kelly, NYT June 1, 2018
    "Female fears of objectification and sexual violence remain as potent as they ever were; the tradwife subculture exploits them by blaming modernity for such phenomena, and then offers chastity, marrage and motherhood as an escape.
    As one such YouTuber commentator, a teenager, told her audience, traditionalism does "what feminism is supposed to do" in preventing women from being made into "sexual objects" and treated 'Like a whore.'"

Hyperbole Doesn't Help
    "If all manifestations of patriarchal sexuality are violent, then opposition to violence cannot explain why pornography (rather than romantic novels) should be singled out as a target." - Willis p.464
        - And worse, the distinction be...

Should Pornography Count as Protected Speech?
    "[I]t makes no sense to oppose pornography on the grounds that it is sexist propaganda, then turn around and argue that it's not political." p.466
        - It should be treated as hate propaganda.


A Defense of Abortion - Judith Jarvis Thomson

[An acorn] is not an oak tree.

- Assume for the sake of argument that the fetus is a person.
- How would that get us to the conclusion that abortion is immoral?
    By assuming every person has a right to life.

"If a human being has any just, prior claim to anything at all,
He has a just prior claim to his own body."

- Assume for the sake of argument that the fetus is a person.
- How would that get us to the conclusion that abortion is immoral?
    By assuming every person has a right to life.
    And that a person's right to life always overrides a person's right to decide what happens in and to her body.
- But Thomson rejects the 2nd part of that.

Rejecting the Extreme View
    - Imagine you are trapped in a tiy hous with a rapidly growing giant baby.
    - You have no moral duty to wait passively for it to crush you.

You Wake Up Strapped to a Violinist. (Like a rape case)
    Is it your moral duty to stay there?

You could save lives now by giving some of your extra money to charity.
Do you have that duty to do that?
